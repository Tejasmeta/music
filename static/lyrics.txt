Generate song lyrics based on the theme: romantic movie
As the sun sets in the west,
A moment turns to a memory I kept.
Remember when our hearts first met,
The feeling that filled our destiny?

In the silence of the night,
When everything's alright,
Let's take a moment and declare,
That our love was here to stay.

No distance can come between us,
Your love will always be true.
Every moment spent with you,
Makes my heart feel new.

In the dark, when doubts arise,
The tender memory of your love will guide.
And when the light returns,
I just want to thank you, for being my missing piece.
